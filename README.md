How to install:
--------------

For Windows 10:

https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex, https://miktex.org/download
Select "install missing packages on the fly" -> Ask me first

For Ubuntu / Debian
https://www.how2shout.com/linux/install-tex-live-on-ubuntu-20-04-lts-a-free-typesetting-system/

sudo apt update
sudo apt install texlive-full 5GB!

Note: Debian doesn't bring windows fonts, if you need Arial (when migrating from Windows),
you can find the fonts on a Ubuntu Machine in /usr/share/fonts/windowsfonts/arial*.ttf and copy
them to the Debian machine.
